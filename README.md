# TFL-Titanic

## About

The preprocessing of the dataset is the same as my Keras titanic solution repository but this time
I've used tflearn. I use Pandas and numpy to preprocess the data and Scikit-learn to split the data
into training and testing. 

## To run

To run the program simply install the requirements and run train.py
